# Rust Genetic Algorithm

This project creates a library that allows users to harness a genetic
algorithm to train a model. The library provides a very generic set of
methods that any model needs to incorporate for the training via the
`Individual` trait.

Also included in this project is an example using the genetic algorithm
to produce a linear best fit line.
